This was my Final Year Project. A Communication System for People suffering with Locked in Syndrome anyone suffering with a form of paralysis could use this 
software to communicate with everyone around him using eyeblinks. Using Dlib and OpenCv eye blinks were being converted to text. The 68 Facial Landmark detector 
model was used.
